> React is a Javascript library for
    Building user interfaces.

    React makes building complex,
        interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.   

    React is all about Components.
        all user interfaces are made up of components.

    What is a component?
        + Reusability
        + Separation of Concerns
        + Don't Repeat yourselft
        + Don't do too many things in one
            and the same place(function)
        + Split big chunks of code into
            multiple smaller functions.
